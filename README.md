# The World

The World allows you to change the password of Toolwiz TimeFreeze. 

Note: The World only works with Toolwiz TimeFreeze 2016.

# Usage

You'll need at least .NET 6 to run The World.

Firstly, build the project and run the executable. It'll replace the configuration file and change the password to `1234`.

If it can't access the configuration files, try running the executable as administrator.
